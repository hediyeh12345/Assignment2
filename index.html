            <h2>Verse 1</h2>
            <p>She lives in the shadow of a lonely girl</br>

                Voice so quiet you don't hear a word</br>
                
                Always talking but she can't be heard</br>
                
                
                You can see it there if you catch her eye</br>
                
                I know she's brave but it's trapped inside</br>
                
                Scared to talk but she don't know why</p>
        </article>

            <h2>Chorus</h2>
            <p>Wish I knew back then what I know now</br>


                Wish I could somehow go back in time</br>
                
                And maybe listen to my own advice</br>
                
                I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out</br>
                
                Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder</br>
                
                Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful</br>
                <article>
                    <h2>Verse 2</h2>
                
                <p>Everything she doesn't see</br>

                You gotta speak up, you gotta shout out</br>

                And know that right here, right now</br>

                You can be beautiful, wonderful</br>


                Anything you wanna be</br>


                Oh, little me</br>

                Little Meeeee</br>

                Oooohhh</p>

                <h2>Verse 3</h2>
                
                    <p>Yeah you got a lot of time to act your age</br>

                    You can't write a book from a single page</br>

                    Hands on the clock only turn one way</br>

                    Run too fast, then you risk it all</br>

                    Can't be afraid to take a fall</br>

                    Felt so big but she looked so small</br>

                    Wish I knew back then what I know now</br>


                    Wish I could somehow go back in time and</br>


                     Maybe listen to my own advice
